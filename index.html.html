    <div class="subtitle">Meet the Founder</div>
    <img src="simone-patel.png" class="responsive" style="width: 240px;" alt="Simone Patel" />
    <p>Simone Patel is the founder and managing director of ScaleUp Partners. She previously owned a business supplying ICU and theater consumables to high-end hospitals in Africa. That experience sparked her passion for helping firms in the HealthTech and Telehealth sectors grow and scale. She identified a gap in the market where not many were using AI to boost business, which led her to start ScaleUp Partners. Her mission is to help firms grow their client base, profitability, and revenue through AI-driven tools, data-driven marketing, and client acquisition strategies. Simone offers business consulting, marketing consulting, and pricing strategy services and partners with HealthTech, Telehealth, and other medical sector firms to help them grow revenue and profitability through AI tools and other strategic methods.</p>

    <p><strong>1. How do you guarantee results?</strong></p>
    <p>We stand behind our promise — we guarantee that you’ll double your investment within 12 months, or we’ll continue working with you at no extra cost until you do. We only succeed when you succeed.</p>

    <p><strong>2. How do you grow your business while growing ours?</strong></p>
    <p>Our growth is directly tied to yours. We operate on a partnership model where we only win when you do. We grow by delivering real, measurable results — from scaling your client base to increasing profitability and revenue. In return, we earn a slice of the success we help create.</p>

    <p><strong>3. What if it doesn’t work?</strong></p>
    <p>If we don’t hit the promised results, we don’t walk away. Our guarantee ensures we’ll stay on board and keep working with you until we deliver. You’re not just hiring an agency — you’re partnering with a team fully committed to your success.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Isn’t email marketing dead?</strong></p>
    <p>Not at all. Email remains one of the most effective channels for building relationships, nurturing leads, and driving conversions — when done right. We combine smart segmentation, compelling messaging, and automation to drive serious ROI through email.</p>

    <p><strong>5. What does a working relationship look like?</strong></p>
    <p>We learn, execute, and collaborate with your team. We retain full accountability while also sharing knowledge along the way. You’ll get a hands-on partner who actively builds and scales with you — not just a consultant handing off advice.</p>

    <p><strong>6. How much of your time do we get?</strong></p>
    <p>As much as it takes. We’re not clock-watchers. We’re here to complete the mission and deliver the results — no excuses, no cut corners. Our commitment is full-time until the job is done.</p>

    <p><strong>7. How involved are you in the closure process?</strong></p>
    <p>We’ll help systemize the entire sales closure process. From lead nurturing to deal closing, we’ll build a killer team with you and refine everything through tracking, auditing, training, coaching, and optimization. We don’t just help close deals — we help you scale the process.</p>
