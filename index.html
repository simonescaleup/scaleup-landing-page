    <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
    <p>
      Simone Patel is the founder of <strong>ScaleUp Partners</strong>, a consultancy born out of real-world experience and a passion for transformation. Having previously owned a successful business supplying ICU and theater consumables to high-end hospitals across Africa, Simone witnessed firsthand the operational challenges — and untapped opportunities — within the healthcare space.
    </p>
    <p>
      That journey revealed a clear gap in the market: while health-focused companies were innovating in care, few were leveraging AI and data-driven strategies to scale their client base or increase profitability. Simone founded ScaleUp Partners to bridge that gap — helping HealthTech and Telehealth firms harness cutting-edge AI tools, refined pricing strategies, and proven marketing systems to unlock serious growth.
